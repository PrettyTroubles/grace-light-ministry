  <h2>You are a Lion<span class="lion-emoji">🦁</span></h2>
  <blockquote>“The righteous are bold as a lion.” — Proverbs 28:1</blockquote>
  <p>The Lord says: You will roar back. You will soar like an eagle. You will decree what Heaven has written about you.</p>
  <p>You’ve been seen as a kitty cat, but the Lord says you’re a lion. The Lion of Judah roars within you. Your past has roared at you—but now, you roar back.</p>
  <p><em>“It’s your time of coming out,” says the Lord. “Arise and shine, for My glory is risen upon you.”</em></p>
